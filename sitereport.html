			When I originally started at NAMI College for my bachelor's degree, I had no knowledge of programming languages or codes. Nonetheless, I chose this course because I am fascinated by coding and programming languages. When I first started taking Web classes, I had a hard time adjusting to the module (CSY1018) and programming languages. But, with the support of my friends and the module tutor, I gradually became more comfortable with the coding. I also viewed a lot of HTML and CSS videos, which were quite helpful. In this module,
			I used all of my time to its full extent. I would talk to my buddies or module tutor if I had any questions about the module. <br><br>
			Now it was time for my project, and we were all running out of time. I had a lot on my plate, and I still had a lot of work to do on my module's skill work. My mind was so frustrated that I was fatigued from all of these chores that I began to tackle them one by one. By the time I started to like my assignment work, I was having a lot of fun writing CSS and HTML code, and our respected sir had extended our time.
			Now our objective was to construct a total of 5 web pages and to visualize my work, I sketched my webpage designs and layout on plain paper.
			To begin, I design a homepage with a navigation bar that includes the following links: home, portfolio, blog, contact, and site report. For serially listing these components, I utilized the li> tag. All of them are linked in the navigation bar. For the link, I used the href tag.
			I used the nav> tag for navigation.
			I picked teal as the color combination since it looks good on any web page. I mentioned my name and welcome on the main page, therefore I used the span> tag to alter the color of specified text on my page.
			For the portfolio section, I've utilized the div> tag and [class=""] it with multiple names to identify it in CSS. This page will have placeholder photos that will eventually be filled with my work from term 2. An image of placeholder images has been added. I've also used gird to add columns to placeholders, and [border-radius] to add curves to the border's corners. The opacity is also lowered to make it more appealing to the eye. In order to match the color coordination, the backdrop color is also given according to the placeholder images. Padding is also done in accordance with the sizes required.

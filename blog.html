			 I started to work on my assignment and had a lot to learn, I had gone through many problems to learn HTML & CSS basics. It was hard at first but 
			Somehow by getting help from my friends, lecturer & internet, I have got some knowledge about HTML & CSS. It helped me a lot through my work regarding assignments.  </p>

			But when I started to create my webpage I was excited to work on it, My mind was full of ideas & confusion. I was so dedicated to my assignment that I was lacking my sleeping hours but it was fun for me, though it affected my performance in classes eventually I recovered and perform well in my classes.</p>

				PHASE-3

			 Finally, I have finished some work on my assignments though it still incomplete the work is in progress it's starting to look fine I'm happy with my work on it. It was challenging at first but I did it and now I'm satisfied, Hopefully, you guys will appreciate my work.</p>
